Knapsack
===========

A DP solver for the knapsack problem. Uses boost:bitset for lower memory usage.
The purpose of this project was to get me started with CPP.

Compilation
-----------
`g++ solver.cpp -o solver.o`

Running
-------

There are some example knapsack problems provided in the data directory. Example:

`./solver.o data/ks_60_0` 
`99837`
`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
